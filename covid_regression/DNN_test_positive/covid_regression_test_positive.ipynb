        "The overall goal of this notebook is to guide you through the process of building, training, and assessing a neural network for solving a regression problem - predicting the COVID-19 positive rate, and provide hands-on experience in improving the model. In the original assignment, the predictions made by the model were required to be uploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ml2021spring-hw1). In addition to the assignment submission, which grants 4 points, each of the remaining 6 points can be gained by passing the baselines tabulated. Notably, a lower score corresponds to a lower test loss, which is better. \n",

        "- To pass the simple baseline, one can just run the sample codes provided in Sections 1 to 5.\n",
        "- To pass the medium baseline, one needs to perform feature selections, specifically only using the one-hot vector of states (40 features) and the positive rates of Days 1 and 2 as the features (i.e. 42 features in total) instead of using all the 93 possible features. \n",

Therefore, there must be an issue of overfitting in the first model."
